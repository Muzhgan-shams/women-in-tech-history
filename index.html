          <p>
            In the late '40s, British mathematician and programmer Kathleen
            Booth wrote the first assembly language for a computing system
            called ARC (Automatic Relay Calculator). ARC‚Äôs assembly language
            directly corresponded with machine code1. Kathleen was ahead of her
            time, researching neural networks and natural language processing in
            the '50s.

          <h5>Grace Hopper</h5>
          <p>
            An iconic American computer scientist and United States Navy
            Admiral, Grace Hopper developed FLOW-MATIC, one of the first
            data-processing languages. FLOW-MATIC ran on the UNIVAC, using
            English-like statements to solve data problems. Grace aimed to make
            working with computers accessible to the average person1.

          <p>
            (March 23, 1928 ‚Äì May 20, 2017) was an American computer scientist
            who developed the FORMAC programming language in 1962. She was also
            one of the developers of the influential COBOL programming language.
            Sammet founded the ACM Special Interest Committee on Symbolic and
            Algebraic Manipulation (SICSAM) in 1965 and was chair of the Special
            Interest Group on Programming Languages (SIGPLAN). She was the first
            female president of the ACM, from 1974 to 1976. 1976.

          <h5>Barbara Liskov</h5>
          <p>
            The invention of CLU was an evolutionary step towards
            object-oriented programming languages. The development of CLU was
            led by Barbara Liskov at MIT. Liskov was the first woman in the US
            to be awarded PhD in computer science. She later introduced concepts
            like abstract data types, iterators, and parallel assignment. Even
            though the language lacked key OO features, it influenced well-known
            modern languages like Java, Python, and C++.
